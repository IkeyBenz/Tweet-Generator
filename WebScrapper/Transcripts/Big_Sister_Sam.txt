Hey, buddy, what are you cleaning for?
Who's that?
Wow, I didn't know you had a sister!
Gee, I'm sorry, Patrick.
It's gonna be okay... you're gonna see her again... today... right... today? Come on... cheer up, buddy. Hey, I'll make sure her visit here will be extra super special, no matter what!
Yeah, Patrick and I go back a long way.  Yeah long way, heh heh, go back.

No, no, don't be upset with Squidward. He doesn't mean it, don't you, Squidward?
Oh, Squidward, you jokester.

Easy now, gents, let's not let tempers flare. Now don't you think, Patrick, it's a teensie bit unfair that sister Sam dismantled Squidward's house?
It's not like that at all, Patrick. I was just-
Squidward... wait, Squidward, w-wait! Before you do anything too rash, let me try to talk to them.
I don't think you should do that.
Now, Sam, it's not what it seems. Squidward was just rearranging the spiffy.
Please don't.
Well, Squidward, at least on the bright side it will motivate you to finally take care of that kitchen remodeled. Right, Squidward?  Huh? Must be getting started.
Squidward, Squidward stop!  Just calm down, buddy. Let's ease that tentacle off of the accelerator, hmmm?
Patrick, I think your sister's temper is getting out of control.
She destroyed my house in a fit of rage! She needs to control her temper!
Patrick?
Aw, she's something, all right!
