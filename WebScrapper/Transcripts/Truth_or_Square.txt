Good morning, Gary!
A little overboard? And take a chance at being late for the single most greatest day of my career.  The eleventy-seventh anniversary of the Krusty Krab.  Oh, oh, oh, I think not.  No self-respecting Krusty Krab employee would be late on this day.
Oh, Watch the potty mouth, Gare. Today is a day for gentle reflection. Aw, I remember my first visit to the Krusty Krab.
Krabby Patty!  Yummy!  Good times.  Oh, sorry, Gary, we can reminisce later. I gotta get ready.

But I don't have time to wait in line. Sorry, but I can't be late today.
Sorry, everyone, but Mr. Krabs needs me.  Reporting for duty, sir.
Happy eleventy-seventh, Squidward.
Aye, aye, Mr. Krabs.
Y-Yes, Sir?
Oh, but, Mr. Krabs.
I thought you said that I was going to be in charge of decorations.
I am?  Yay!  Yeah! Yeah!
Wow! Fifty cents!
Yee-haw!
Do you come here often?
There we go.
Your change, sir.
Every word, Squidward, every word.
Yes! Yeah! Ooh, I almost forgot. Mr. Krabs, wait! There's one last decoration!  I present to you...   I present to you...  ... my ode to the Krabby Patty  made entirely out of ice.
Ready? Set?  Guys, I'm okay. No need to scream.
Oh, no. Patrick, stand up!  We're locked in!  This is gonna spoil the eleventy-seventh anniversary.
How do we get out?
Not to worry, Squidward. I have the entire map memorized.
Hurry up, guys, this kind of hurts.
Don't worry Squidward. We'll find a way out and then we'll have the best eleventy-seventh anniversary ever. All we have to do is stick together.
Gary the snail, you get down from that this instant.
Look, it's Sandy!
Thank you, Mr. Krabs. Dental hygiene is very, very important.
I think that's us, Patrick.  But, who are they ?
That might just be my hand, Mr. Krabs.
Lead them? I can finally  use my leader hat...  and my lederhosen.
Follow me!
Guys, its a dead end.
Ow!
Plankton,  you're trying to steal the Krabby Patty recipe again.
You know, this reminds me of the time Mr. Krabs confided in me the Krabby Patty recipe. Oh, I don't want to bore you with my silly old stories.
Well, okay. Mr. Krabs called me into his office.
You mean?
We wanted to make sure we weren't followed. Then, Mr. Krabs leaned in close and whispered the recipe.
But, Squidward, you're glad I moved in. Remember that day.  ah-uh.  Nah.  No.
It's beautiful.  I'll take it.   Hi, neighbor!  I'm SpongeBob SquarePants.  And we're going to be bestest friends.  Hey, Patrick. Guess, who just moved in right next door?
Oh. If only Sandy was here. She could help us.
Remember the day Sandy and I got married?
Mm-hmm.
I do.
♪I'm ready, I'm ready to go to work.♪
Ready!
Yeah!  Hello, Krusty Krab!  ♪I'm ready, I'm ready to go to work.♪
♪I'm ready, I'm ready to go to work.♪
I'm ready!
Ready!
Well, hello.  Are you okay?  Mister?
And we didn't even get to celebrate the Krusty Krab's eleventy-seventh anniversary. We missed what could have been the greatest party ever!
No, Patrick, I don't want to give up.
Guys, we can't give up now. We got into this mess together, and we'll get ourselves out of it the same way.
No. By using our heads.
No.  As a battering ram.  Hut.
Okay. This is the one. Feel very good about this. Okay. Ready?
Oh, it was not for nothing, Squidward. I spent the whole day with my best friends.   You, Squidward.  And you Patrick.
And let's not forget the man who made it all possible. Mr. Krabs. What could be better?
