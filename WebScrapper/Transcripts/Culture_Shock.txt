Aye aye sir
 Welcome aboard, sir
 Here at the Krusty Krab, you are the captain, and I am your cabin boy
 You just say the word and I will throw myself in the brig
 May I take your order
Aye-aye, sir
  Monsieur's change
I've got one
  A free pair of socks with every purchase
 Or maybe 'Double Patty Midnight Madness'
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
 I know
 I know
 I know
 How about 'mouth full of clams' day
 Everyone who shows up with a mouthful of clams
  
gets a free drink
 Huh
 Huh
Hoppin' clams
 A talent show
 I'm talented
 I'd better call my folks
Hey Squidward, what time am I going on
The show
 When am I going on the show
 I have a great act
Ta-da
Ok, I get it
 Don't worry, Squidward, I'm going to come up with the most cultured act ever
Wow
 A full house
  There's Mom and Dad
 They are gonna be so proud
I gotta get ready
Hey, Squid
 How about this for the show
  The Amazing Mister Absorbency
  Ta-da
  Ta-da
Please, Squidward, let me be in the show
 I'll do anything
 Anything
 Anything
Oh, yes
So, this is what it feels like
 the big time
 With this mop, I shape my destiny
Hey, Squidward, listen, what do you think
 When I mop, should I go forward and back
 No, no wait, side to side
Squidward, should I use Mr Cleanser or Dr
 Clean
Hey, Squidward, can I go on now
