This is it, Gary!
The big boating exam is today! I've never felt so capable!  I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready. Squidward! Squidward!
I'm ready, Squidward!
No, I'm ready to pass my boating test.  I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready...  I'm ready-eady-eady-eady-eady-eady-eady-eady-ready. Well, pal, I won't be needing you anymore.  I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready! Oh, yeah! I'm ready!
Hey, I'm getting mine next!
Okay, see you on the road. I'm ready! Here I come, Mrs. Puff! I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready.
Hi, Mrs. Puff! Today is the day I'm going to pass my boating exam!
First I must pass the oral exam. I am confident in my abilities to successfully succeed.
The bow.
Stern.
Starboard.  Port. Skipper. Deck. Cabin. Galley. Keel. 1924.
Oh, in this boat right here?  Is it time already?
Oh yeah, absolutely.
1924?
The boat?
Floor it?
Floor it?
Okay, floor it.
I don't know why, Gary. I don't know. I'm tired of failing that boating test. I've already taken it thirty-seven times.
Okay, thirty-eight.
No, Gary, I'm not walking.
What is it, Patrick?
Oh, Patrick, I'm not in the mood.
Okay, now what, Patrick?
Okay, I'm at the closet.
I don't know, Patrick.
Pat, don't do that.  I've got too much to worry about.
I can't pass my boating exam. I've taken it thirty-seven...
...uhh, thirty-eight times. I know all the answers...  ...until I get behind the wheel. I just need something to help me think straight.
How are we going to do that?
Hey! I can hear you in my head! This is great! While I'm taking the test, you can give me all the answers.  Wait a minute, Patrick. Won't I look silly with this antenna coming out of my head?
Sponge to Pat, I read you loud and clear, over.
Moo.
Here you go, ma'am.
Uhh...
Mrs. Puff. Mrs. Puff!
It's okay, it's only the boat.
I... I think so.
1924?
Put it in drive?
Floor it?
I'm cheating?! Mrs Puff!
I think I'm cheating.
I think I am cheating!
I do have an antenna under my hat!  There is a guy giving me all the answers! It's all true!  I'm cheating! I'm cheating! I'm cheating!
I'm sorry, Mrs. Puff! I'm sorry!
Cheating... I'm a cheater! Cheater...
No... I'm cheating...!
Cheating!
I'm a cheater, cheater, pumpkin eater!
No...!
Cheater...!
Mrs. Puff, I think I cheated.
Uhh, I'm sorry for letting you down again, Mrs. Puff.
Don't worry, Mrs. Puff. I'll try harder next semester.  It'll be great!  Only now I don't even have my bike.
Gary! My bike! You found it! This sponge is still mobile!  Alright, let's go surprise someone at the hospital!
