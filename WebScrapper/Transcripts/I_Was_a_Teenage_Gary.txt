Exercise time is over, Gary.  We don't want you getting too thin.  Here, boy. Fetch!
Huh?   Good job, Gary!  I love you, Gary!  Gary, Gary, Gary, Gary, Gary!  Ha, ha! Down, boy! Ha ha!
For what?
That was this weekend?  I can't go; I don't have anyone to take care of Gary!
Squidward, could you watch Gary this weekend?
Not a Gary... Gary. He's my pet snail.  Say hello!
I love Gary!
I guess we can't go away this weekend after all, Patrick.
Actually, a three day weekend.
Yeah, but you've already said you can't do it, we understand.
You'll do it? Great! Let me show you a little bit about snail care. You need to take Gary for a walk...
Let me show you how to feed him.  The cans are all marked, a can in the morning and a can at night.
Now, you won't forget my instructions, will you?
Gary.
See you later, Patrick.
Gary! I'm home!
Squidward! What are you doing here?
What a great friend you are, Squidward.
Thanks, Squidward.  I can always count on you.  Gary! Gary, what's happened to you? What's wrong? Squidward, something's wrong with Gary! Squidward!
What?
I knew it! Oh, Squid, did you hear that?
Aren't you going to do it?
Squid, wait! I can't give Gary his plasma. I'm squeamish too.
Gary!
Now, don't hurt him, Squidward. Okay, okay, steady.  Wait, that's too hard. Okay, okay, okay, try it again.
Ouch! Uh, Squidward, you just injected me with snail plasma.
What's going to happen to me?
I don't know, I feel kind of funny!
Oh, Gary, you're better!
Squidward, wait, the snail plasma!
Don't worry, Gary, Squidward says I'll be fine. He knows everything. So, you hungry?
Here ya go. Eat up, Gary.
Sorry, Gary, I couldn't control myself.  Meow. Why did I just do that? Am I cracking up?
No, no, Squidward's right. I'm fine. I- I worry too much. It's all in my head. I feel tip-top!
Gary, you're getting a  lot faster!
Look at me. Never better.  I'm okay! Squidward said I'm fine!
Gary... I'm fine!
Yyyyyy-yyyooooou'll see.  That's okay, I'm a lefty anyway!
