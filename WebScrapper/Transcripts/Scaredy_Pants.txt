Huh
 Who's there
Okay, Mr Krabs, the dishes are done, I'm leaving
No thank you, Mr Krabs
 Uhh, does it have monsters in it
Uhh
 no
  Is it a true story
Okay, maybe just a little
Excuse me, did his ship look like a Krabby Patty
Do souls look like pickles
Humph, Squidward
The name's SquarePants
 It's SquarePants
  I don't get it, Gary
 Every Halloween, no matter how hard I try, everybody scares me
Well, I'm sick of it
  No more ScaredyPants
Gary, it's Patrick
 I'm going to scare him
 It's my turn
  Rawr
Why can't I be frightening for once
 Where's my chance
What do you think
No, no
 I'm the ghost of the Flying Dutchman
I don't know, Patrick
Rawr-rawr
Okay, okay, here's your candy
I don't get it, Patrick
That is it, Patrick
What's the difference between that ghost and me
I have a square head and a real ghost has a round one
 All we have to do is make my head round and boo, I'm scary
Remember, like this
Shave me down, make me round
What do you think
Oooh
 I'm the Flying Dutchman
Rawr
 Rawr
 I'm the Flying Dutchman
Do you think
Who should we scare next
Rawr
 Rawr
 I'm the Flying Dutchman
Okay, Patrick, kill the lights
Help
 Help
Do you mean I'm not scary
Hey, what do you know
 I scared him
  It worked, Patrick
 I scared everybody
Pink hat
 Oh, that's not a hat
 That's my brain
Don't worry, it grows back
