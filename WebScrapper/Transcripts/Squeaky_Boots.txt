Oh, uhh, Mr Krabs, can I get my paycheck
Uhh, sir, I can't see you
 The boots  are in  the way
Wow, really
 Why is that, they just look like any old ordinary boots
Who's that
â™ªI'm ready
 I'm ready
 I want those boots
Hmmm
 I know
 What if I give you my Krusty Krab paycheck
And what if I paint the Krusty Krab for free
And I'll throw in a year's supply of French fry orders
And
Hey, Squidward
 Do you like my new boots
 Pretty cool, huh
 Now, I'm an official fry cook
Hey, Mr Krabs
Are you kidding
 I love them
 Could the world's greatest fry cook do this
Or could he do this
  Or this
  And watch this, Mr Krabs
Could the greatest fry cook do that, Mr Krabs
And watch this, Mr Krabs
 And this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this
Gary, these boots have changed my life
 I'm never taking them off
Good night, Gary
Mr Krabs
Oh, Mr Krabs, I'm sorry
 Sorry
 Sorry
 I'm sorry
No, it's not okay
 I lost the boots
 Your valuable boots, it's my fault, I let you down
 Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry
 Ohh, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry
Yes, it is
They're not the same
 You were right
 I wasn't ready for those blessed boots
I heard his order, Mr Krabs
 He says he wants 
Could the world's greatest fry cook do this
 And this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this
Umm, why did you eat my boots, Mr Krabs
You really think so, Mr Krabs
Bye, Mr Krabs
