Come on, Barnacle Boy
 There's evil afoot
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy spot their arch enemy, Reflecto, up to no good
You know what this means
By the power of Neptune
Creatures of the deep, assemble
  Think
 harder
 Barnacle Boy
  Here they come
Blast, Reflecto has become too powerful
If Reflecto is cut off from sunlight, he becomes weak
Quick, Barnacle Boy, back to the sea cave
Reflecto has found our secret lab
Elaborate, you vile fiend
Hmm, they must be working undercover
Excuse me, I know that Mermaid Man is working undercover on an important case, but you think we can see him
Patrick
 Can you believe it
Are you Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy
But you can't retire
 There's evil afoot
All I said was, there's evil afoot
Wow, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy
What do you mean, Patrick
 Old people are the greatest
 They're full of wisdom and experience
  The world needs Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy
 Someone, somewhere, is in trouble, and I won't rest until Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy are out of retirement
Hey, Mermaid Man
Hold on
 Just let me look at ya
Do you remember the time the food supply in Atlantis was running low
 So you invented a ray gun that makes things grow six times their size to shoot at the kelp gardens
 But then the evil Man Ray swoops down and swipes the gun away and shoots all the algae
  And he globs onto the undersea dome
  And he starts sucking on the glass
You guys are the greatest heroes of all time, and I think you should come out of retirement
No, but I'm married
Oh, mah
 This purse is so big and heavy
Hay-lp
 Hay-lp
 Hay-lp
Wha, are you here to rescue little ol' me
Ever alert, Mermaid Man has trained himself to sleep with his eyes open
Excuse me, Mermaid Man
This'll cheer you up
 We're almost done painting your invisible boatmobile
Pinch me, I must be dreaming
  Mission accomplished, Patrick
Wow
 That was even better than the old show
