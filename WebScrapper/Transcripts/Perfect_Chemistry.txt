Nu uh uh! Lab Partner!
You called me SpongeBob. I thought we agreed to address each other by our proper titles.
Uh ta ta ta! Lab Partner!
We did it!
Plankton? is that you?
Yes, sir. The lab is amazing.
Here's your teleporter, lab partner.
Can you please call me lab partner?
Oh, I guess you won't be needing me anymore.
Need me?  How could I help? I'm not even a  scientist.
Test monkey,  Test monkey reporting for duty!
Hey! Who turned out the lights?
Do you think this is a good look for me? Or is it too flashy?
Clear of what?
Look, no hands! Or feet.
Ooh, I gotta go to the bathroom.
Oh no! Plankton has finally won! And we, we helped him.
The Krabby Patty formula! But if that's here, then where's Plankton?
