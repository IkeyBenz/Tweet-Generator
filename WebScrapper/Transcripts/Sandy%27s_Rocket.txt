Hey, Sandy
 Hey, Sandy
 Hey, Sandy
  Wow
What is it
Wow, what are you gonna do with it
The moon
 Can I go
But I don't take up that much space
  See
  I can fit in here
  Mmm, cozy
Well, how about
  This
  Or this
  Or this
Fine
  Put me in the brig, I don't mind
Oh, please, can I go
 Can I
 Can I
 Huh
 Please
Yeah
 Goin' to the moon
 Moon ride
 Moon ride
 Moon ride
Wow, look at that pop gun
 Are we gonna go hunting aliens on the moon
Well, when you're done playing with rocks, you could use that for some serious alien hunting
Sandy, Sandy, Sandy
 How could you be so naïve
 There's evidence all around us
 How do you explain Atlantis, cow licks, 99¢ stores
  And how about those mysterious circles that pop up in kelp fields over night
  Ah
 There's one now
Oh, hurry up
  These oughta do the trick
What is it, Patrick
 Can't you see I'm sleeping here
A present
There are no aliens, Patrick
 Just ask Sandy
Alien repellent
 Let me see that
  New Alien-Out Window Protectant
 Does not stop burglars
 Well, I guess you're right, Patrick
 We'd better go spray those windows
It's pretty impressive, all right
We're just here to spray the windows, Patrick
We don't, we're just spraying the
  
windows
Yeah, just don't touch anything
Patrick, cut that out
 Patrick, come on, we can't hang around in here
 This is Sandy's big rocket, not some kind of a fun
  
house
Hey, Patrick, what game was that, anyway
Patrick, I don't think we should
No more
  Okay, one more
  Okay, that's enough
 Let's go
Patrick, what are you doing
 I'm the space traveler here and I happen to know that that particular button is right over here
Look
  We're in space now
 Wee
Hey
 You got your toothpaste in my peanut butter
  Patrick, I can do this
We must be landing
Wait, don't go near it, Patrick
 Can't you see this is all a trick
 The aliens are projecting our memories onto the environment
 They're trying to confuse us, Patrick
Okay, but I'm not gonna to fall for it
  Yeah
Sandy
 I forgot about her
 She's gonna hate us for stealing her rocket
 But won't she feel silly when I bring home a real live alien
 Aww, she'll love me
  Come on, Patrick, the more, the merrier
Shh, quiet, Patrick, don't let them know we're onto them
 Uh, yeah, alien hunting
 I saw that on TV, too
 Gee, Patrick, let's drop in on our old pal Squidward and see what he's up to
  Make sure your gun is pumped
  Look at it, Patrick, it's disgusting
  It's even uglier up close
 Let's begin the analysis
Patrick, do you know what this thing is
No, it's an egg sack
 Let's look at the embryo
Let's capture the little phony
We don't want your money, moon man
  Look at them squirming around in there
Well, there's plenty more where those came from
There's no time for that
 Just push harder
Nice try, Sandy
It just goes to show you: you can't trust anyone
  So, you were an alien all the time and you didn't even tell me
Yeah
 Well, I got you now
Boy, I can't wait to see the look on Sandy's face when she sees this
  Sandy, I'm back
  Wow, Bikini Bottom sure looks different
  Uh-oh
