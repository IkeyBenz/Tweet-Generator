Hike, Patrick, hike
  You just lost three points
  One
 Two
 Five
  G-7
But it's not Tuesday, Patrick
Now what
Okay
 ready
I got it
 I got it
  I got it
 I got it
 I got it
  Remember, Patrick, finders keepers
Uhh, Patrick
 I think something's wrong with Squidward
 He looks unconscious
Get off him, Patrick
But he still feels cold
Do you think he'll be okay
I don't know
No, no, that part goes here
We're almost there
 We can do this
This is working
  Patrick, this isn't working
I don't know how to say it, but our old pal Squidward, he's
 He's
 He's pushing up daisies
No, stay back
It was an accident
Please, Mr Squidward's ghost
  Spare us your ghostly anger
We'll do anything you want
 Just have mercy on us
Does that include
Here
Here
Here
Too tired
Only the freshest, o spooky one
  A grape fresh from the vine, your ghostliness
  A banana peeled to your liking, your incorporealness
Art thou not pleased
Whatever you want, we'll find it
 We'll find it
Flank steak
But this is just a piece of tissue paper
I can't do it
Patrick, are you ready for this
Okay, let's go
 Patrick, are you coming
Patrick, it's this way
Here
It's easy
 Just tear this wallpaper off
Oh, let's see
 It's a comic book, and look at this
 It's the Origin of the Flying Dutchman
  It says when he died they used his body as a window display
 Now he haunts the seven seas because he was never put to rest
 Well, don't you get it, Patrick
No
 We're gonna put poor old Squidward to rest
Initiation
 That was part one of your ceremony
We're going to put you to rest
Yeah
Okay, get in
But you said we could put you to rest
I wrote “Here lies Squidward”
 You may not remember him, but
  Oh, hi, Squidward
 Does this look deep enough
Oh, look, the mourners have arrived
No, just into this hole
You're bald

Go home
As you wish, master
No, Patrick, he's the fool
 He's a ghost in denial
 He needs us now more than ever
Patrick, say that again
No, the other thing
No, what you said before when you
Never mind
 I've got an idea
I can't reach him
Isn't he beautiful
All the way, Patrick, up to the great beyond
  Goodbye, friend
He's on the other side now
