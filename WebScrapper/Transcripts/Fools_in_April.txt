Wake up, Gary.
We're moving today!
That's right! We're leaving home. We're going to become peasants!
No more food.  Sorry, Gary. Peasants only eat mashed-up clamshells.  April Fools!  There ya go, pal!
Whew, I'm thirsty!   This is an extreme thirst!
Whew, I'm exhausted. I sure can't wait to drink all of these drinks! April Fools!  To me!
Yeah, but he told us to tell you...
He told me to tell you... April Fools.
Squidward, wait!
Wait, Squidward!  It was just a joke! No more jokes on you today, I promise!
Sure, there are lots of other willing participants. Right, Mr. Krabs?
They're right here, lady!
April Fools!  Welcome to the Krusty Krab. How may I help you?
Hey, what's that?
April Fools! I'm right here!
Sure! A couple of ice cubes coming up!  Here you go.
April Fools!
I...  I...
You asked for a couple of ice cubes in your drink, and I only put in one!
Hey, your shoes untied.  April Fools! You're not wearing shoes!  April Fools!
Oh, boy! Something for me to clean up!
Whooaahh!  Whoa! Blblblblblblblblblblblbl...
Whoooooooooooooooooooooooooooaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
What do you want?
What?
What?
I can't. I don't have a bottle opener.
But I couldn't...
Squidward! Is all that true?
Even the part about the lima beans and the car chase?
I promise.
What would we do without Squidward?
