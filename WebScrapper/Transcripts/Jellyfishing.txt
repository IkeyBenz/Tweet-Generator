I think I've got it! Wait a minute...
Hey, Squidward, we're jellyfishing.
Wait! We made a net especially for you!  Do you want to come with us?
Next time?
You know, Patrick? It always seems like Squidward never has time for fun.
No, are you kidding? We're his best friends.
Squid's back!
Hey, Patrick, Squid's home! And we're gonna make sure he's greeted by his two best friends!
Us!  Let's go!  Welcome home, Squidward!
We're gonna make this your best day ever!  Well, your best day's sure not gonna be out there.
I don't think soup is the best thing for him on his best day ever.  How about some music on your best day ever? Played on your very own clarinet.  Sorry, my lips are a little dry.
But what is best is what we saved for last. The one sure-fire thing to make your best day ever the best day ever!
This is Jellyfish Fields, where wild jellyfish roam just waiting to be captured.  No, no, Squid! Over here! I know you're eager, but you don't even have your net. Patrick, fix him up while I find him a good specimen.
There's one in position. Ready... set... go!
Hey, look! Squid's doing it!
He's a natural!
Yeah, you're doing great! Go, Squid, go!
Yeah, you got, Squid!
Be the net!
Yeah, go by the eye of the tiger, by the eye of the tiger, by the eye of the tiger! Better, better, better! Yeah, yeah, yeah! You've got it now!
This is really your best day ever, isn't it?
Hey, Patrick. Well...  Thought yesterday went...  pretty well, don't you think?
Me too.
Oh, great.  Hey, Squid! How about that...  ...best day ever?
Um, we're really sorry about what happened yesterday, Squidward.  Um, we got you a present!  It's the jellyfish.
You're not still mad, are you?
