Another funtastic day at Glove World
Let me get my wallet
  Wait, let me check this pocket
  No
  Patrick, do you have any change
How much is it
Fifty cents

What did you say
Thanks, mister
Okay
 Here's my glove light
I see you
Cool
Yeah, Patrick
Where did you see that
What
Patrick, I think we're on the wrong
  
buuuuuuuuuuus
 
bus
  But, sir, we need to get back to Bikini Bottom
Rock Bottom
  It sure is weird around here
 Kinda different, even the soil looks different
Uhh, that's an easy one, Patrick
 We just wait for somebody to come out and then you'll know
  Maybe we should wait for one more
Uhh, uhh, okay
 You wait for the bus
 Call me when it comes and I'm gonna get a bus schedule
  Boy, this place sure is creepy
I guess Grandpa SquarePants was right
 Don't run for a bus
  Especially one that's going up at a 90-degree angle
  I better go wait for the next one
  C'mon, bus
 I've got to get home and feed Gary
  Uh-oh, shoe's untied
  Over, under, and over, and loop-dee-loop, and over
  and through the hole
  My balloon
  Wait
 Hold on
 Stop that bus
 Aww, not again
  Umm, excuse me, sir
 Can you help me
  Uhh, uhh, yeah, I
  No, no
 Not the balloon
 I need to know what time the next bus comes
  Well, there goes another one
 I gotta be more diligent
 I am not leaving this spot, no matter what
  I'm gettin' hungry
  Glove candy dispenser
 Good thing I went to Glove World
  Eww, glove flavored
 Hey, what's that
  A candy machine
 Mmm, kelp nougat crunch
 Mmm
  I'm not leaving this spot, no matter what
  I'll only be gone a second
  Hey
  Ooh
  Come on, come on
  Hey, that was mine
  Barnacles
 Alright, that's it
 No more mister nice guy
  Tartar sauce
  Fish paste
  I'm getting to the bottom of this, right now
 I want a bus to Bikini Bottom
 I am first in line and no one is going to tell me, otherwise
  Okay, second
 I am second in line
  Okay, third is good
  Fourth, not bad
  Okay, 329
 I am 329th in line and nobody forget it
Well, at least the line is moving
  Tartar sauce
Finally
 Yes, I'm next
  When is the next bus to Bikini Bottom
The bus schedule
 The next bus
The next bus
  to Bikini
  Bottom
Oh,  no
  you don't
Hold it, I'm not through here
  Do you hear me
  I demand you come back and give me a bus to Bikini Bottom, right now
 And until then, I am not leaving this spot
  Okay, like I said, I'll be right here when you get back
 At this spot
 In the dark
 By myself
 With no one around
 Except my glove light
  Ah, that's better
This isn't your average everyday darkness
 This is
 advanced darkness
 Hey
  if I close my eyes, it doesn't seem so dark
Who's there
  Well, I guess that spot will be there tomorrow
 I better just keep walking
  Running
 Better start running
 Running
  Sprinting
 I just gotta keep sprinting
  Sitting, sitting
 Bleeding
  Hey, who's there
  Okay, that's enough
  Don't come closer
  I'm warning you
  I'm a sponge
  Oh, it's only you
  Well, that solves my balloon problem, but I have a bigger problem
  I'm kinda stuck here
 I need to catch a bus to get home
 You don't understand a word I'm saying, do you
 Balloon
  has
  enough
  air
  thanks
  Hey, I get it, balloon travel
 Thank
  you
Ah, home at last
