Order up Squidward!  I'll bet you're wondering why I'm not using my hands today.
OK, OK, I'll tell you.
I'm not using my hands because today is "Work Without Your Hands Day".  You should give it a whirl, buddy.  Krusty Krab, SpongeBob speaking. Just a minute please. Mr. Krabs, it's a Queen Amphitrite. She wants to have King Neptune's birthday party here.
So much for "Work Without Your Hands Day," SquarePants. You answer to a higher calling this day. I have the capability!  OK, that's enough Patrick, thank you.
All set, Mr. K. 5,000 patties, one for every year Neptune's been alive.
Excuse me, Mr. Royal Sea Kingness, your table is this way,sir.
Triton, Triton, Triton? Is there a Triton here? Is there anybody missing from this party that any of you guys can see?
Oh, I was sure there's somebody.. Oh! Here it is right here. An empty seat.
No, not that chair, your Highness. That one, see? It even has its pretty name card that I made still on it.
T-R-I-T-O-N. You sure you don't know anyone named Triton?  Should I put it down yes or no?
Oh no. This is all my fault because I mentioned  Triton.
Stop, Squidward, please stop! Your descriptions are too horrifying for my delicate sensibilities.
Hey, that's it! I'll fix all this by reuniting Neptune with his son!
Thanks again, Mr. Bus Driver!
Now, all I've got to do is find King Neptune's long-lost son.
What theâ€”I had the strangest dream that I just got hit in the head with a tiny toenail clipping.
Hey, I was right! It is a tiny toenail clipping.
Another one!  Plus some rope.
Who said that? Show yourself! I'm warning you. I know how to use these!
Oh, hello, little fella. Maybe you can help me. Because if I don't find Triton soon, Krabs is gonna be real upset, because he spent a lot of money on party decorations.
For King Neptune's birthday!
You mean, you're King Neptune's son?
Well, he sure seemed upset that you weren't at his birthday party.
Well, thanks, but...
You're right. It just doesn't make any sense.
I mean, gods shouldn't have to use nail clippers. They should be able to wear their fingernails to whatever length they want!
Don't go.
What if there was a way to free you from this magical cage? Then, you could come to your father's birthday party and settle your differences!
Sorry, I haven't had anything to drink in a couple of days, my throats a little dry.
I'm sorry, I'll stop talking, I swear
boy this really does look complicated, oh I see, I'll just slide this square to the right, this one goes up, one other here and ohh wait, no, ahh, no squares  man that really is a tough nut to crack
Cheap bag of potato choo wait a minute, which way to the nearest phone booth?
Patrick?
Oh Patrick, you made it, this is the magical lock I was talking about,
Yeah, I tried for hours and hours but I just can't get it to...
Wow, all ready, Patrick you know I'll never figure out how you do those so darn fast.
Amazing!
Wow!
Sure Triton, what do you need to use, the bathroom.
What's happened here?Hello, where is everybody?
the Krusty Krab!
But look, that mail hasn't been picked up today.
We better use the secret entrance.
Be very very quiet.
Oh, this is terrible
Only as long as King Neptune is locked up.
Yeah, Triple Gooberry Sundays tonight after we free them.
Make ready the disguise.
Okay, now!
Quick Patrick, unlock it before he sees us
Hurry up Patrick, he's getting bored
Did you hear that, Neptune this was all because of me.
Yes Patrick?
I think now would be an excellent time, yes.
