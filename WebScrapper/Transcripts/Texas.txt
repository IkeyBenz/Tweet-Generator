Good morning, Bikini Bottom
 Ahh, what a beautiful day
  I wonder if Patrick's at home
Goin' over to Sandy's place
  Hey, what's this
 This doesn't look like Sandy's place
What is it
Texas
 What's a Texas
All right then
 Let's make one of your treedome
Sandy
 Hi-yah
Oh-ho
 I get it
 Not feeling up to karate, huh
 Whatever you say, Sandy
  Boy, I hope Sandy doesn't attack me from me from behind
 Hi-yah
Uhh, Sandy
  Surf's up, Sandy
Boy, there's nothing like going jellyfishing
Look, Sandy, we caught one
We don't eat 'em
 We let 'em go
Go on, go back to where you belong
  Run along, back to your family and friends
 I know they miss you as much as you miss them
 Hurry, before they forget you and leave you behind
 Remember: there's no place like home
  Sandy, what the heck are you crying about
Sandy
Homesick, huh
  Almost there
Da-ta-dah
Sandy
I don't get it, Patrick
 What's wrong with Sandy
Patrick, do you hear that
Wait, Patrick, listen
 It's Sandy
Patrick, she sang that song from her heart
 She really misses Texas
Patrick, we can't
that's it
 Patrick, your genius is showing
Everything looks perfect
 We're going to get Sandy now
Shh
 Don't spoil the surprise
You want to come with us to the Krusty Krab
What are you doing with those bags
What
 Now
 You can't
 I mean we
Wait, Sandy
 You can't
 Uhh, we we're gonna
the
the
Krusty Krab
that is not the right direction
 Wait, if you don't
if I can't
augh
 Sandy
 Wait a second
 You don't wanna leave without having one last Krabby Patty down at the Krusty Krab
But, Sandy, don't you want to say goodbye to all your friends down at the Krusty Krab
No, no
 Wait
 Sandy
  I can't believe she's gone
You mean we can't say anything bad about dumb ol' Texas
Oh, so you mean we can't say anything bad about
  Texas
Look, Patrick, I'm Texas
 Duh, howdy, y'all
 Howdy y'all
Howdy y'all
The stars at night are dull and dim, whenever they have to be over dumb ol' stupid Texas
  Hey, Patrick, what am I now
No, I'm Texas
You'll have to catch us first
  We did it
 We got her
Okay, Patrick, that's enough
Run faster, Patrick
No
 Almost there
Sandy, no
It's a party
It's your own little slice of Texas
 Check it out, Sandy
 We got square dancing
  
giant Barbecues
homemade peas-in-a-can pie
  
and we got our very own 10 gallon hats
  So, what do ya think
 Are you gonna stay
Don't cry anymore, Sandy, I'll go get your bags
Does that mean you'll stay
That makes me feel all wiggly
