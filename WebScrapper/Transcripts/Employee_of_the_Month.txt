Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward.
Do you know what today is?
No, silly!  That's on the 15th!  Today is the beginning of the judging for Employee of the Month.
What do you mean?
That is not true, Squidward. He gives it to me because I work harder. You could win it too, if you tried harder.
Squidward, you've got it all wrong. Having pride in your work is nothing to be ashamed of, why it's the only thing that makes it all worthwhile.
Huh?
Nooo!  How could I have let the quality of my work slip so much?!
Making...Krabby Patties?
Please don't tell Mr. Krabs about this! It'll hurt my chances of winning the award!
That is not true, Squidward. Like this hat, that award is a symbol of...
No, Squidward!
An experienced employee of the month always keeps a brick of lead in his hat.
What if Squidward's right? What if the award is a phony? Does this mean my whole body of work is meaningless?!
But, sir…
Crystal, sir!
I won't let Squidward win!  He can't go to work if he doesn't wake up. Target sited.
You can't win that award if you don't get up for work!
That can be arranged.
Maybe so, but I did win 'Employee of the Month' 26 months in a row.
I've been better than you 26 months--and it'll be 27 tomorrow.
Well, I'm going in early to wax the floors!
Well, you'll have to get up pretty early to get there before me!
Well, me neither! …26-time loser!  Look at him. Watchin' me.
Hey, Squidward, getting sleepy, huh?
Nope!  Nighty Night.
Hey, Squidward! Going somewhere?
All right, Squidward. I'll stop by after work!
Now to get some rest. Don't want to look tired for my 'Employee of the Month' photo!  Squidward!
Ha ha ha ha ha. Hmmm, a Krabby Patty!  Ow! Squidward!
Truce.
You're right. We should save our energy for work where we really need it.
And may the better man win.  He's nothing but a lying, boneless, ink-squirting, big-nosed phony!
As soon as he stops shaking my hand...
Look, Mr. Krabs! Clean floors!
Clean dishes, Mr. Krabs!
It's much more efficient to clean dishes this way, Mr. Krabs!
Look, I'm putting my own money in the register, Mr. Krabs!  Two spatulas to increase productivity, Mr. Krabs! Faster, SpongeBob, faster!
So, who's the winner of Employee of the Month?
