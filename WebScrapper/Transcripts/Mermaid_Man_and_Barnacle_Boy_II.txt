I'm ready
 I'm ready
Aw
 I worked forever on those life-size Krabby Patty mannequins of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy
Hey
 SpringBoob SquirePin stole my idea
Whahoo
  Oh, I wonder when my  prize will
  get here
  My prize
  Can it be
 It is
  The conch signal
  From The Adventures of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy
  As seen on TV
  I wonder if it still works
Hmm
  Maybe the conch signal doesn't work anymore
I can't believe it, Gary
 Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy in our home
Excuse me, I'm
Oh, that was me
 I blew the conch signal, sir
Don't worry
 There's no danger
I won it in a contest
Yes, sirs
Don't worry, Mermaid Man
 You won't be hearing from me for just anything
 Only for the big emergencies
Help
 Can't
  open mayonnaise
But
I'm sorry, Barnacle Boy
 I didn't mean it
 I
 just wanted to spend time with you
 You're my heroes
Oh
Hey,  can I drive
Tons
 Like the windshield wipers are right here
Hey
  I've got the doughnuts
You're under arrest, Atomic Flounder
But you said he could snap
  
just like that
I can't believe it: I rode in the Invisible Boatmobile, met a villain, and learned to treat third-degree burns, all in one day
 So, what are we going to do tomorrow
Okay
It doesn't seem to be here
Aye, aye, sir
Aw, that's the 15th time I've looked
  But I can't let my heroes down
I found it and it's the special dance mix
Holy Krabby Patties
 Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy's arch nemesis: The Dirty Bubble
 I can't believe it
You don't understand
 You're my most favorite super villain
 Can I get your autograph
I am
Oh
