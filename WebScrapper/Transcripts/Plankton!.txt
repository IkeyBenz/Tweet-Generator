Oui, oui. Un Krabby Patty, Monsieur. First, les patty.
Next, les ingredients.  Ah, oui!  Les mustard.
Les hold on a second!  And voila!  It's under your nose!
Look at it, Squidward. Mr. Krabs' gift to all of Bikini Bottom -- the Krabby Patty..
I swear I'm not doing anything. Mr. Krabs! The Krabby Patty is haunted!
Uh..Plankton, sir?
Okay, Mr. Krabs, see you tomorrow!
Plankton? What do you want?
Um...no.
No.
I...guess so.
Wow! A golden spatula! And it's even got my name on it.
A booster seat?
You just want to be friends so you can get your hands on a Krabby Patty! And I bet it's not even your birthday tomorrow.
You'll never get a Krabby Patty from me!  Even if we are friends!  Never, never, never, never!
Good night, Gary.
Morning already?  I... I feel a little funny today.
Time for a well-balanced breakfast.  This isn't what I had in mind.  Let me just grab my pants.  I guess I'm not wearing any pants today.  I guess I'm not using the door either. See you later, Gary! ...I guess.  You're right, Gary! There is something wrong with me! Squidward! Squidward! Wake up! I need some help!  Squidward! Help!
Help!
Something must be wrong with my brain!  Plankton!  What kind of friend are you?
Get out of my head! Leave my brain alone!  Never! Never!
No, never!  You can't fool me, Plankton, you want the Krabby Patty secret formula!
No, no, no!  There's no one here.
I must fight!
I just have to say I'm sorry I let Mr. Krabs down.  I let all of Bikini Bottom down. But worst of all, I let you down, you delicate little Krabby Patty.
With your tasty, juicy, scrumptious, warm, steamy goodness.
I'll never forget your 100% all-secret patty, secretly assembled with undersea cheese, pickles, lettuce, tomato, onion, all secretly steamed between two fluffy seaweed-sea buns.
Well, patty, I guess we can go home now.
