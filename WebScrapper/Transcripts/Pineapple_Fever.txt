Hey, Patrick.
All ready to go jellyfishing today?
I see you even brought your double net.
Um, Patrick? Don't you mean twice as fun?
Your— never mind.
Good idea.
Here we go.
Patrick, help me get these boards nailed up.
Start dec— you sir, obviously do not recognize fine decorating when you see it.
Admire it later, Patrick. Right now, we got to get my house converted into a shelter capable of withstanding extreme weather.
Actually, I can't.
Because I just stepped on one of these nails.
Whoo! Nice work, buddy. Now my house can withstand anything nature has to throw at us.
Squidward! Did you come to weather out the storm with us?
The one Preflumster told us about.
C'mon Squidward, it'll be fun! While the elements rage outside, we'll snuggle in here and pass the time by playing board games, and playing tic-tac-toe, and drinkin' hot cocoa, and playing tic-tac-toe, and doing jigsaw puzzles, and watchin' TV, and drinkin' hot cocoa, and doing jigsaw puzzles, and playin' board games, and drinkin' hot tea...
Oh, yeah. Hot cocoa... we'll be drinking.
Even if I let you borrow my huggly snuggly bunny slippers?
Okay, but you better think fast. Because Patrick really likes my—
Squidward, welcome back! Here's your slippers.
That's better.
Squidward, the lights went out.
Patrick! What is it?
Thank you, Patrick.
Okay, boys, let's roll to see who goes first.
Oh, yeah.
Two.
Oh, it's a tie.
Tie.
Tie.
Yeah, it looks like a lot of junk.
Yeah, relax, Squidward. We're just here to have fun.
Oh, okay, yeah, okay. Here we go. Congratulations, Squidward.
Come on, Patrick. You can do it.
Be the puzzle piece.
Come on, Grandpa, you can do it. You still got a good few years left in you.
Go, Patrick, go! Go, Patrick, Go! Go, Patrick, go! Go, Patrick, go!
Go, Patrick, go!
Hang on, Squidward. Patrick was just about to figure out where this last piece of the puzzle goes. Weren't you, Patrick?!
Squidward. It wasn't your turn. That's cheating.
Oh, it's okay, Squidward. We'll just start over.
Oh, welcome back, Squidward. We were about to figure out where the first piece of the puzzle goes. Oh, maybe Squidward can help us fig—
Please, Squidward?
Please...
What is it?
I have a question.
Where are you going to get the chalk?
Halt! Nobody's to cross this boundary.
If you're the one who drew it, let me see some identification papers.
Hmm. You may be telling the truth.
But then again, you may not. Come with me. We shall find out the truth.
Stop that cephalopod!
This, I cannot allow. It is against the rules.
Patrick, look out!
Your food?
Apparently so. Well, that and a refrigerator full of food anyways.
It's just Patrick gnawing on his can.
I don't hear anything.
Squidward, wait!
