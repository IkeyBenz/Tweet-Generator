Mr. Krabs, what's wrong with Pearl?
Oh, hi, Mr. Krabs! Are you talking to that dummy I made? It's pretty realistic isn't it?  I made this part out of...
Really? Oh, wow! Don't worry, Mr. Krabs, I am a prom expert!  Oh, Gary, I'm a prom failure. I couldn't even get a date for my own junior prom.
No, that was Patrick who brought his mom. Besides, how am I supposed to compare with Pearl's old boyfriend, Mr. Long, Tan and Handsome?
What is it, Gary? What do you have?  Hey, Gary, this magazine gives me an idea!  Long.  Tan.  Handsome. Okay, Gary, wait ‘til Pearl gets an eyeful of this!
Uhh, Pearl, we've got to get back to the limo.
Well, I guess the first thing we should do is...
Uh-uh-uh... our first prom picture.
Be right there.
Just a second. Coming!  Sorry! Pardon me! Here I am...! Cheese...!  That'll be a keeper.
Prom expert; away!
Hi, Pearl! Come on, it won't bite!
What is it?
Whoa. But, I bet he isn't holder of the Regional Romance Dance Championship trophy!
That just didn't happen. Let's go!  Ready?
The whack? Oh, yeah, I invented that one.
Don't cry, the prom expert is here! I haven't failed yet!  Hey, we can still... no, I broke that. We could... no. Don't cry! D-d-don't cry.  Whatever you do, don't...
— Messed everything up.
— Hot dog!
All I wanted was to have a good time!
Can I still wear the wig?
Let's go!
Gee whiz, Pearl. I'm sorry tonight didn't go out like you planned.
Ah, there you are, dummy! You sure come in handy! .
