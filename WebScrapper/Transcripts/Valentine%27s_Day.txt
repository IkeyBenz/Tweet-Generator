Happy Valentine's Day, Bikini Bottom!
Well, I'm bubbles for you, Sandy.
Okay.  Step one:  Patrick and I get to the Valentine's Day carnival.  Step two: I position Patrick and myself on top of the Ferris wheel.  Step three: You arrive at designated checkpoint for maximum visual contact.  Step four: Patrick is thrilled. Mission accomplished.  Hi, Patrick.
Patrick, it's me, SpongeBob.
Patrick!
Patrick...
Patrick, I'm right behind you!
And I have a present for you!
It's the greatest...  ...the bestest...  ...the most fantabulous...  ...present ever!  But you can't have it yet.
Because it's not ready yet.
Not yet.
Do you want to ruin the surprise?
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh!
Hmmm...nope, sorry.
No can do!  You'll just have to wait!
Okay, Patrick, here we are
It's not the carnival.
Here, why don't you take this quarter and...
It's not the quarter.
Now, take that quarter and buy some cotton candy...
Ten-four, Sandy, SpongeBob here.
Ohh, not yet, Sandy. Patrick's still trying to guess what his Valentine is.
You'll have to guess!
No.
No.
Nope.
Are you sure?  SpongeBob to Sandy, you can bring it in now.
Late? But what about...  ...Patrick?
If Patrick doesn't get his valentine...
Patrick! Uhh, actually it's on the Ferris...
Well, this is where you're gonna get it...I hope. Just keep looking out there, pal.  SpongeBob to Sandy, SpongeBob to Sandy, come in, Sandy!
No, no, B, Sandy! No, B!  Uh, Patrick, you know how sometimes you plan something special and things don't just work out?
Patrick, here it is!
It's a handshake...a friendly handshake.
A friendly handshake. Happy Valentine's Day!
Uh, no problem, Fran.
You too, Dave.
Patrick!

Okay, Patrick, I know I deserve this.  But, do they?
Yeah! Sandy's here! Woo-hoo! Look Patrick, it's here! It's here! The best valentine in the whole wide world is right behind you!
I'm telling you, it's right there, turn around!
Patrick, just turn around!
Happy Valentine's Day, Patrick!
Patrick, no!
