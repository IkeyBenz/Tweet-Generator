Yippee
 I'm rich
 Look, Patrick, eight gold doubloons
Boy, Mr Krabs, you sure are sweaty
There are no real doubloons, Mr Krabs
 It's a game: "The Flying Dutchman's Treasure Hunt"
Take a break and play around with us
I cleaned the tables, Mr Krabs
I already took care of it
My turn
  One, two, three, four
  Look for the Deacon's Goose thru the fork in the old tree and head that way
  Well, I see Mr Krabs' zipper is undone
Just kidding, Mr Krabs
 I'm almost to the treasure
 Your turn again, Mr Krabs
You are a real pirate
 Go straight to the "X" that marks the spot
 You get to dig for treasure, Mr Krabs
Hey, Mr Krabs is getting all sweaty again
I think we ought to call it a night, Mr Krabs
 I really got to get some sleep
I'm sorry, Mr Krabs
  See you tomorrow
  Huh
 Who's there
Mr Krabs, it's late
 Go to bed
 Good night, Mr Krabs
Mr Krabs, you gotta
But, Mr Krabs
But, Mr
But, Mr
MR
 KRABS
 I WANNA GO TO BED
 Mr Krabs, I'm sorry, but it's just a game, ya know
Aw, go home already
 I'm done playing that game, Mr Krabs
Pirates
Oh, Patrick
 Look
 Peg legs and eye patches
Look, I'm Peggy the Pirate
Ow
Really
 Can we see the map
Okie dokie, then
Okie
 oops
  I mean
  arrgh
 Captain Krabs
  Captain, we're about to hit
 uhh
 I mean
 arrgh, Capt
, arrgh, we're, arrgh, about, arrgh, to hit, arrgh
The whole ship is underwater captain
But, Mr Krabs, that seaweed has
  Which way, captain
Mr Krabs, we're tired
Yeah, we'll be your loyal crew
I'm so loyal, I don't even mind sleeping on the cold, hard ground while Captain Krabs sleeps in his warm, dry tent
But we've only been gone a few hours
I'm so loyal, I don't wanna sleep till we find the treasure
 Let's go see if the captain will go now
He's not here
Only the captain can look at the map, Patrick
Patrick, what are you doing
Patrick, you're not supposed to look at the map
No, guess there isn't
  Oops
 Patrick, it opened by itself
Yeah
You mean, like that it's our game board taped to a piece of paper
Not at all, Captain Krabs
 We don't think that at all
Look
 It's the "X"
Wow
 That game really is based on a real treasure map
We got it, Captain Krabs
What are you going to do with your share, Patrick
We found it together
 So we deserve a share
What about loyalty
And one for all
And one for all
And one for all
And one for all
Wow
