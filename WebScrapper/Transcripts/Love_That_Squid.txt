Squidward!  You dropped your ook!
Don't be sad, buddy. Turn that frown upside down!
Just remember, Squidward. You have never experienced true love. BUT that doesn't mean you will never find it! You know the saying: There's a squid for every pot!
Well, why don't you ask her out on one of those dates you keep talking about?
Boy, you are floundering up there!
Squiddy, you've been bitten by the love bug!
Squidward, I can help you attract your true love!
Oh no she's not! Hang on, buddy!
Hey, Idward Squay. 'Emeber ray the eat day.  I believe Squidward here is trying to ask you on a romantic date, ma'am. Right, Squidward?
Come on, Squidward. Shake the nice lady's hand and say "Hello."
Oh, yes. He-he's just tired, you know, from all the hard work he's been doing around here. I so admire his work ethic.  So, what do you think? You want to date him?
Wait a minute! Before you make any hasty decisions, allow me to tell you a few things about my friend, Squidward. Things I think you should know, like that Squidward is by far the single most intelligent person I know.
That's right! We are talking some serious credentials.
The point is, he thinks you look like a ray of pure sunshine in that dress.
You betcha! He's such a charmer.
Not to mention that he's an incredible painter, a virtuoso musician, loves to cook and clean and also enjoys gardening quite a bit, too.
But you know what is the most amazing thing about Squidward?  It's his selflessness, his undying commitment to being a true friend. And I know anyone who is lucky enough to go on a romantical date with this guy would get to experience things on a whole 'nother and very special level. So, how does dinner at 8:00 sound, Squilvia?
You okay, buddy. You froze up there, buddy.
I mean, when was the last time you went out on a date?
You, my friend, are in desperate need of a practice date.
Just meet me at my house at 5:00, Squidward.
Just one minute, Squidward!
I'm ready!
Oh!  Missed a spot!  Aren't you going to compliment my outfit?
Oh, you're so sweet! Where are my flowers?
I don't think I've dropped anything... Ooh! You shouldn't have.
No, you really shouldn't have. It's just that I'm very... I'm very aller...  ...very allergic to tulips. Anyway, are you ready to go?
To dinner, silly.
A gentlemen always opens a door for a lady.
No, no, I've got it!
Ah, snug.
Yes.
Right after I tinkle.  Oh good thing i went, i don’t think i would’ve made it to the restaurant. Is something wrong Squidward?
Great, well I know a fabulous place! Just head this way.
Okay now at this stop sign turn right.
Now at this light make a right.
Now at this street here make a right. And at this intersection here make a right, and then park right near the orange building just up ahead. Ooh! We're here!
Oh why, thank you, Mr. Squidward!  Way to compliment the date, Squidward.
Now, it's the chit-chat part of the date. Amuse her with an interesting conversation.
Okay, good effort, but you might want to start with something more personal. A woman may like to talk about her day, for example. She may want to talk about her promotion at work, or the wacky antics of her pet snail, or talk about how I was nearly late for our date because I couldn't decide what to wear, and then I didn't really have enough cash to give the lady at the nail salon.
Now this is the perfect opportunity to work on your table etiquette.
Squidward, could you please pass the roasted kelp?
Oh thank you, sir!
Well, this is my home, silly.
Squidward, wait! We haven't covered...  We haven't covered all the tenants of Dating 101 yet!  As I was saying... I, I would like to go over just a few more crucial aspects of the first date.  Such as...
Um, Squidward..
Um, Squidward.
Does this mean there won't be a second date?
Have fun, you two! SquarePants, your work here is done.
