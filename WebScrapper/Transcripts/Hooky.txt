Almost
 There's a nasty barnacle under table nine
Warn him about what, Mr Krabs
The hooks
What could be worse than that
Don't let 'em get me, Mr Krabs
Aye, aye, Mr Krabs
Hey, Patrick
I can't leave now
 I'm working
Where is everybody
Doesn't look like any carnival I ever
  Excuse me
  Stop, Patrick
 Don't touch it
 This isn't the carnival, Patrick
 Those are hooks
 Mr Krabs says they're really dangerous
All I know is Mr Krabs said-- Patrick, don't do that
But, Mr Krabs said
Patrick, don't
Patrick
 Help
 Oh, Patrick, help
 Oh, Patrick, come back
 Oh, my best friend
  Patrick, you're alive
But
what about the surface, and your britches, and the gift shops
Mr Krabs said I shouldn't get near those things
Well, no
I guess he didn't
Ready
This is more fun than double overtime at the Krusty Krab
Again
I
I
I
Gift shop
Okay, Gary
 Today is a new day
 I'm ready to prove myself loyal to Mr Krabs
I'm ready
  I'm ready
 I'm ready
 I'm ready
 I'm ready
 I'm ready, ready, ready
 I'm ready
I always go to work this way
But, Patrick, we promised
You don't have any fingers, Patrick
But Mr Krabs said
Umm
Ooh, I know I want to, but I promised Mr Krabs I wouldn't go near another
  
hook
  Oh no
 Mr Krabs told me all about you
 You are a liar
 A deceiver
 I'll never fall for your tricks again
 Never
  Is this seat taken
  Whew
 Glad I got that out of my system
  I'm
hooked
 And that means
  Help
 I'm hooked
 Help
 Mr Krabs
 Help
 It happened
 I'm hooked
 Oh, no
 The hook
 The hook
 Gift shop, tuna can, mayonnaise
Psst, Mr Krabs
Um, you know those hooks we were talking about yesterday
Umm
no
  I mean yes, yes, you told me not to go near them
Of course not
  I mean, not exactly
  I mean yes
 Yes I did it
 I admit it
  Oh, Mr Krabs
 I'm so ashamed
 I mean, look at me
 I'm hooked
What am I gonna do
Oh no, Mr Krabs
 I can't take off my pants
 Not in front of all these girls
  Dâ€™oh, okay
 I'm taking em off
 I'm taking 'em off
  There
Oh no
 Oh no, no, no, Mr Krabs
 I can't do it
 Anything but that
Oh, Mr Krabs
 I'll listen
 I promise
  Please save me, Mr Krabs
  I promise I'll be good
  Whew
The pants
 The underwear
