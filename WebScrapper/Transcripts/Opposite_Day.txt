Yeah
 So long, Squidward, bye-bye, don't do anything I wouldn't do
Umm, Squidward, why are you playing that drum
Squidward
 You need bed rest
  I'll keep you safe until you're well again
Uhh, Wednesday
Does everybody know about Opposite Day
Oh, a game
Quiet and out of the way
 Yay
I love
 I mean, I hate Opposite Day
  I'm not ready
Gary
 It's Opposite Day and I
  
walk, don't run
 And I'm gonna
 opposite
 opposite
 I'm just gonna crawl into bed and do nothing all day
  Too bad it only comes once a year, huh, Gary
Gary, whereâ€™s your holiday spirit
Company
 I hate company
 Who's there
Patrick
 go away
 I never want to see you again
That's right
 You're my worst enemy
  Patrick, you're not really not my friend
 It's just Opposite Day
You have
Well, whatever you normally do, today you do the opposite
Patrick
 Patrick, breathe
  Not that opposite
 Let me show you how to do it the wrong way
Meow
Kcirtap yeh
Edis etisoppo eht ot teg ot
Say, want to help me do some work around the house, worst enemy
Hello, Squidward
 Oops
 I mean, goodbye, Squidward
 Aww, isn't Opposite Day
  
terrible
Wow
 That's the nicest thing Squidward has ever said to me
On Opposite Day it is
I don't get it
 I made my house a mess, which was making it clean, which made Squidward clean my yard,  but that really means he's messing it up
  But the opposite of clean is filth, which means filth is clean, that means Squidward is really making my yard a wreck, but I normally wreck my own yard which means,  Squidward is being the opposite of Squidward which means he's SpongeBob
  A-ha
 I understand everything now
 I must be the opposite of SpongeBob
 By being
  Squidward
Wait
 It's not enough to look like Squidward to be opposite
  
you have to act like him, too
 Boy, oh boy, do I like playing the clarinet
 I practice and practice all day long, but I never get any better
  Now you try
After you, Mr Squidward
You're quite welcome, Mr Squidward
Yes, please come in
Yeah, everyone says that
Positive things
 Opposite Day
  I'd love to
 The floor creaks, the roof leaks, there's a terrible draft
Please, let me finish
 The winters are harsh, the summers are brutal
 There's a wild man-eating clam in the backyard
  Now, would you care to see the rest of my home
Nonsense
 I won't take no for an answer
  Please follow me
  And here's the worst room in the house
 My gallery
I'd like to introduce you to Mr Squidward
I'm Squidward, he's Squidward
Okay
I hear you loud and clear
Don't
Patrick, do you ever get the feeling that Squidward likes us too much
