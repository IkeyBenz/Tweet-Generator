What a great day.  Hey, Sandy! Look!  I'm Sandy!  Hey Sandy, who am I?  Hello, SpongeBob. Could you keep it down? I'm trying to be boring.
Did anyone order twenty pepperoni and sand pizzas?
Coming.
Good job, Sandy. Well, that's about enough for today, don't you think?
All right, stand back, everyone.
Could I borrow a couple of these?
I got it!  Incoming!  Oops, I guess I ripped my pants again!
Hey, Sandy, how about throwing it to me?
I could use a hand here!
I guess so...  ...except I ripped my pants!
I'll take a banana split.
That's okay. I already split my pants! Get it?
How about ripple?  No, thanks, already got one!  Is that a burger you're eating?
You know what would go good with that?
Ripped... pants.  Ripped pants a la mode!  Delivery! Did you order twenty cases of ripped pants?
Come closer.  I need... I need...
A tailor.  Because I ripped my pants!
Come on, SpongeBob, you're losing them! Think! Your public's waiting.  Let's see...  "Lifting weights - big laugh," "Frisbee in face - kills," "Surfing - knocks 'em dead," "Pretending to drown,"  No. Come on, think! I got it! Hey, everybody!  Not ripped pants!  Pants ripped off. Huh? Someone call the police. There's a pants thief on the loose!  Oh, no, everybody's gone, even Sandy. She'd rather hang out with Larry! Oh, no.  We blew it, pants.
Oh, I didn't have to be a fool to get Sandy's attention. Am I the biggest loser on the beach?!
Ouch.
I lost my best friend.
When I ripped...  my pants.  I thought that I had everybody by my side, but I went and blew it all sky-high, and now she won't even spare a passing glance, all just because I  ripped my pants.
♪I know I shouldn't mope around, I shouldn't curse, but the pain feels so much worse. 'Cause winding up with no one is a lot less fun than a burn from the sun...♪
♪Now I learned a lesson I won't soon forget... so listen and you won't regret. Be true to yourself; don't miss your chance... and you won't end up like the fool... who... ripped... his... pants!♪
Sandy!
Absolutely, buddy.
