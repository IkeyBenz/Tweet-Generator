Well, yeah, but...
Well, okay. Wait, don't tell me.

Right, back... it up.
Okay, okay.

It's an old pioneer trick. I saw it in a movie once.
Shh, shh, shh. It's working.
Truck! Sixteen wheels. Now I can show you how the pioneers hitchhiked.  Whee... eee...

I can't, it's for the customer!

I think town's this way.
That's right.  Moss always points to civilization.
Yep.

I heard in times of hardship, the pioneers would eat coral.  No, maybe it wasn't coral.  Maybe it was sand, no, no, mud.
Wait, I remember now. It was coral!
No, we promised it's for the customer.
Yeah!
Well?
Okay, it's fine.
Yeah.
Yeah!
Yeah!
Wait a second, I know what you're trying to do, Squidward.  I'm not letting you eat the pizza!
No!
Get away!
No!
No!
No!
No! No!
Look, we're saved!
No, really Squid, we're saved! We're saved! We're saved!
Saved, saved, saved, saved! Saved, saved, saved, saved, saved, saved!  Saved, saved, saved, saved, saved, saved! Saved, saved, saved, saved, saved, saved! Saved, we are saved!
It's not just a boulder.  It's a rock.  A rock! A rock! Its a big beautiful, old rock.  Oh, the pioneers used to ride these babies for miles, and it's in great shape.
I can't wait to see the look on our customerâ€™s face!
Congratulations, sir. Your Krabby Patty pizza is here!
What drink?
But, you didn't order any...
But... but...
Did he change his mind?
No drink?
Are you kidding? We have just enough time to make it back to work.
