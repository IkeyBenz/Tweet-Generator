Behold the ultimate cooking utensil, the golden spatula!
Only a fry cook worthy of King Neptune himself can wield...
Oh, oh, oh, oh! Take a picture of me and the spatula!  Okay, I'm ready!
Menu section? That's easy, it's over that way.  Uh-oh.
Uhh, Patrick...
Uhh, I did, Mr. Neptune, sir. SpongeBob SquarePants.
But, but...
Like?
Actually, I've got two.
Patrick! You hurt my friend! You're not a king, you're a bully and a liar!
I will accept your challenge if you fix my friend.
How you feeling?
I'm ready.
May the best man win.
I'm not good enough to cook in Atlantis, Patrick. I should have never taken the challenge.
Once upon a time...
Perfect!
So, uhh, what do you think?
What's so funny?
You mean, Patrick can't come?
And my friends?
I know, Mr. Krabs, I'll miss you, too.
I... I...  I don't wanna go!
Wait, Neptune! I have another idea!
Hi, Patrick. What'll you have?  Can you excuse me?
What did I tell you about using your powers, trainee?
