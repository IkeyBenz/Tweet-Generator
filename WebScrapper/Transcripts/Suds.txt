Ah! It's raining Krabby Patties! Yeah!  A quick midnight snack and then it's back to bed.  Aww, sleep tight, my little angel.  Ah, here it is.  Nothing like a sea-nut butter and jellyfish jelly sandwich to get you to sleep.  The fridge!
Oh, Gary, I don't feel like myself.
Don't be silly, Gary. I don't get colds. I get the suds.
No, Gary. If I had the suds, I'd have bubbles coming outta me.
I can't get the suds,  because then I'll have to miss work!
No, Gary. I like wearing my underwear like this.
I'm not sick. I'm going to work.
Right away, sir.
Here's that patty you wanted, Mr. Krabs, sir.
No, Mr. Krabs, I'm okay, honest.
Oh, Gary, I feel horrible.  Oh, who am I kidding, Gary? I've got the suds, no doubt about it.  I'd better take care of this before it gets out of hand.
Sandy, I'm sick.  Can you escort me to the doctor's?
Yeah, okay, Sandy, thanks.  Coming.
I'm sick, Patrick. I'm going to the doctor.
Why not, Patrick?
It can't be as horrible as the suds.
Is that the horrible part, Patrick?
No!
No, no! No stethoscope, no doctor, no old magazines, no hiss! No!  Patrick, I don't want to go to the doctor.
You gotta help me get better, Patrick. Please? Would you like to be my doctor, Patrick?
I don't know.
No bubbles! Patrick, your treatment is working!
Sure! At this rate, I'll be cured in no time. In fact, I'm going to call Sandy and tell her not to come. Thanks, Dr. Patrick!
My fingers are too big for the buttons.  Dr. Patrick, will you call Sandy for me?
Uh-uh.
Not really.
I don't...think so.
No.
Nope.
Uh-uh.
Hiya, Sandy.
Ahh...
I'm okay, Sandy, really.
I'm better, guys! Really!
Guys!
I can't stop now!  Help me!
Mr. Krabs!
You're not going to make me read old magazines, are you?
Whoo! Yeah! Whoo!  This tickles!  I can smell again!  Whoo! Yeah! Yeah-eah! Whoo! Yeah!  I feel as good as new! I love the doctor!
