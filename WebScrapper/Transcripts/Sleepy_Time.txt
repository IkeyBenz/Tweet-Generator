Ah, time for bed, Gary.
Oh, Gary.  You know what they say: curiosity salted the snail! Mind your wandering eye, you little mollusk. Sweet dreams, Gary.  Hey! Over here!  Wait a minute. I don't have a driver's license!  Wow. My driver's license. I can't believe it!  I sure take a good picture.  Darn! I should have grown a mustache.  How could I have forgotten the most important rule of driving? Always wear your seatbelt.  Hey, I can see the Krusty Krab from here.  Mrs. Puff! Look! I've finally got my driver's license!
No!  Ouch! Where am I?  Is that me? Or is this me? Am I still dreaming?
This must be Gary's dream. I'm gonna get a closer look.  Whoa! Wow. Look at all these books. I wonder where Gary is.  Gary! Huh?  Excuse me, sir. Have you seen...?
Gary?
Gary! You can talk!
What does that mean?
Who?
Gee, Gary, you sure are smart.
Well, thanks for the info, Gary. I'm going back to my own dream now.
I wonder what Patrick's dreaming.  I can't resist!  Hey, Patrick!
You know, Patrick, this is a dream. You can do anything you want.
I mean anything! Watch. I can turn into a skyscraper.  Going up! Eh?  I can make...  A million of me! Eh? Eh?
Ah, tartar sauce. I'm going to a different dream.
Ooh, this is gonna be good!  Psst! Squidward!  Hey, Squidward!
Squidward!  Huh? Huh?
Trust me, Squidward.
La la! La la la la la la la!

So long, Squidward!
Hey! I'm at Sandy's!  Aw, this looks neat! I wonder...
Hey, Sandy! What's going on?
This seems kind of dangerous!
Okay!
Gotcha!
Ouch! All right, that's it. No more messing with people's dreams.  H-h-hey! Mr. Krabs.  Uhh... Mr. Krabs?
Oh, Pearl. This is your dream.
Actually, I was looking for your dad's dream.
Bye!  I bet Mr. Krabs' dream will be more robust.
Whatcha doinâ€™, Mr. Krabs?
What are you talking about?
Look, Mr. Krabs. Pennies!
This one?
Wow! You look real good with a mustache, Mr. Krabs.
Net ready, sir!
Congratulations, Mr. Krabs.
Huh?
Hey! Hey! I...!
This'll make a great fish story, eh, Mr. Krabs?
Yes, Mr. Krabs?
Ooh! Hey, Plankton's dreaming about Bikini Bottom.
Plankton!
This isn't a dream! This is a nightmare!
Gary! Gary! No!
Gary!  I've got you, Gary!
I think he's got the point.
Ooh!  Ah, that was fun and all, but it's good to be back in my own dream cloud.  Ah...
What do you want with me?! Leave me alone! No! No no no no no no!
Hey, what are you all doing in your pajamas? Are we having a slumber party?
