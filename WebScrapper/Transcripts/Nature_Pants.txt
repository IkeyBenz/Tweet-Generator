Mr Krabs, what do we do
Well, I
Well, I've been thinking
No offense, Mr Krabs, but I've been thinking about giving up my cold industrial life in favor of a more natural and free life among the jellyfish
I can too last more than one day
 I'll show him
 Aw, barnacles
And Squidward, I want you to have my can opener
It's all yours
All yours, old friend
  Patrick, there is one more thing I want you to have
No, Sandy, I'm giving up my material possessions to live in the wild with the jellyfish
Oh, oh, Sandy
 That's exactly the response I would expect from someone who lives the sham of a life I once lived
 I'm gonna prove I don't need all this stuff to be happy
  Maybe someday you'll wise up and join me
 Goodbye
  I won't be needing these
  Buzz, buzz, buzz
I'm home
 I'm home
 I'm home
 I'm home, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home
  Brothers and sisters, wait for me
  Buzz buzz
 Buzz buzz
 Okay, I'm here
  Wait, I just got here
 My jellyfish instincts tell me to go
  
that way
  Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz
  This is the life
  Hey, everybody, buzz buzz
 Buzz to you
 Buzz, buzz, nice current today
 Hey, what's the buzz
  Hello, I'm JellyBob, and you are
  Uhh
 nice to meet you
Patrick, I'm not coming home
I'm happy here
 This is my home now
Hey, everybody
 I'm back
 I think I'm getting the hang of this
  Patrick
 What are you doing
Patrick
 Go home
 I'm a jellyfish now
Patrick
 No
Well, that's over
 Back to jellyfish matters
  Mmm, jelly
  Ah, my jellyfish brethren are returning
  Greetings, comrades
  Being a jellyfish sure is fun
 Buzz

  Buzz
  Hey
 Eww, I'm itchy
 Itchy, why am I so itchy
  Ah
 Poison sea urchins
  Ow, ow, oh, itches
 Ow, ow, itches
  Buzz

  Krabby Patties
  Sandy
  What have I done
 I had a great life and friends, and I gave all of that up
You guys are the best
 I made a huge mistake
 Please forgive me
Don't mind if I do
Aye, aye, captain
Don't mind if I do
  Ta-da
  Aww
It is great to be home
