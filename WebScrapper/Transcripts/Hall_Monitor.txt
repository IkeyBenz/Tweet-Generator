Yahoo! Hall monitor SpongeBob reporting for duty, ma'am! I am ready to assume my position... in the hall! I will protect all that are weak... in the hall! All rules will be enforced... in the hall!
I can't accept that yet, ma'am. First, I have to make my speech.
Classmates! Who am I to deserve such a great honor? Why, I would be nothing without Mrs. Puff.
And to my public, all I can say is I'm touched. And furthermore, I will carry out my duties...  ...crime and punishment, punishment and crime in the hall!  Which reminds me of an extremely long speech written by the greatest hall monitor of all time.  "Friends, students, juvenile delinquents, lend me your ears."  In conclusion, and without a moment to spare, I will put on this uniform  and assume my duties as...  ...hall monitor! Wish me luck, Mrs. Puff!  Oh, and I will be re...
I overdid the speech again, didn't I?
Aww, tartar sauce. I guess I won't be needing this.  I hardly knew ya.
Yes, Mrs. Puff?
A-hoo!  Thanks, Mrs. Puff!
Broken traffic light! Who's to say my monitor duties should end just because the bell rang? I can be helpful anywhere! This looks like a job for the hall monitor!  What would this town do without you, SpongeBob?
On patrol. I'm on patrol.  Uh-oh, an open window.
The fools. They've left themselves susceptible to danger. I must show them the error of their ways through example.  I'm the open window maniac!  I hope you learned a valuable lesson!  On patrol. I'm on patrol. I'm on patrol...  Vandals! Another crime.  hmm...strawberry! I must act!  Patrick...  Patrick... Patrick...
Patrick! Down here!
Patrick. Come down here.
I'm down here.
That's hall monitor to you!
Sorry's not good enough, Patrick. You've committed a crime, and I'm taking you in.
"Maniac. Bikini Bottom? Car wrecks? Break-in?". Who better to bring this maniac to justice than me, the hall monitor! But I can't handle this case alone. Patrick, are you ready to give up your life of crime?
Hmmm... now you just need a symbol of authority.  Perfect! It is our duty to catch this maniac and bring him to justice! But how to proceed? Listen, deputy, you're an ex-criminal. What would you do?
Okay, now what?
This isn't working. We've got to do something else. Something with walkie-talkies!  And now, duty calls! Alright, deputy, I'll go that way, you go some different way! Run â€˜em out!
SpongeBob here, Patrick. Report.
Get a hold of yourself, deputy.
Poor rookie. Alright, I'm on my way back.
Just put on your siren and I'll be right there.
Where is he, Patrick?
That's where I am! He's right on top of me, but I can't see him! What's he doing?
Say again, deputy?
Huh, this guy's not half-bad-looking for a maniac. Wait a minute, Patrick, I'm the maniac!
Yes, Mrs. Puff?
