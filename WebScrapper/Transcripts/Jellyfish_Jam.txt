Safety first
  A-ha
 I finally gotcha
  Ah, there is nothing better than the taste of natural jelly from a jellyfish
 See you later
  Oh, oh my glasses
 Thanks, little guy
 Bye
  I can't play anymore, jellyfish
 I got to get home
  No
 You can't go home with me
  Jellyfish, you've got to stay here
 Hey
  Stay
  Stay
   Jellyfish
 For the last time, you cannot come home with me
  Ahh, what the heck
  Squidward
 Hey, Squidward
 Squidward
 Squidwardiard
  Squidward
 Look at my new pet
No he isn't
 Watch this
 Fetch
  How many fingers am I holding up
  Play dead
Well, we're going to my house to have a little fun
Whew
 Wow, you sure like to dance
 Well, that's enough for tonight
 It's time to go to bed
  Huh
  You got it all wrong, little fella
  Bed
 Repeat after me
  Bed
  We'll just keep you right here
Quit worrying, Gary
 He'll be just fine
 Good night, everybody
Good morning, Gary
 Good morning, jellyfish
 Jellyfish
 Jellyfish
 Here, jellyfish
 Oh, jelly
Oh, jellyfi-
  Where'd you all come from
  Okay, that's it
 Party is over
 You guys have overstayed your welcome
  This music is way too loud
  Very funny
  I'm serious
Come on, guys, enough is enough
  Huh
  Uh-oh
 Hey, take it easy
 Ow
 Okay, I'll talk to him
  Squidward
 Would it be possible to play your clarinet a little
 better
 I don't think the jellyfish like it
Okay, he said he'll play better
  Uh-oh
 That's not better
  Hey
 Take it easy with that
  Those are my things
  Don't break th- Dow
Hey, now, that wasn't nice
  Okay, that is it
 Everybody out
  Come on, Gary
  Gary, you were right
 Thanks for not rubbing it in
  Huh
 They stopped
  Gary
 Don't
 stop
 shaking it
