Good morning, Squidward
 Wanna go jellyfishing
  Great
 We'll be right over
Ready to go
No, Patrick, he's just not ready
  Ready now
How about now
Now
Now
How about now
Now
Now
Now
Now
Ready yet
Sure we do
Ready
I'd love to be at work today
 But it's Sunday; the Krusty Krab is closed
Well, he's not here
 I'll bet that eager-beaver's already down at Jellyfish Fields
Does this mean you wanna go
