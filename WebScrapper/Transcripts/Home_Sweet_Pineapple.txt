Hooray, Gary! We're finally huge!
Huh? Wait a minute! Oh no!
Shellphone! I know, I'll call Squidward. He'll know what to do!
Squidward!
Squidward! Help me! My house is shrinking and I woke up this morning and it was getting smaller and smaller...  Oh no!
Ohh... nematodes.  The only thing left of my house is this little pebble.
I've got bad news, guys! Look at what happened to my house! It's gone! It's all gone. What am I going to do? Where am I going to live?
I guess I'll have to move back with my mom and dad.
We can't build a house!
Alright, Patrick, lets get to work!
Yeah! So what do you think?
Really?
One bedroom.
Well, looks like we've got to move back with Mom and Pop.
That'd be great!
Good night, rockmate.
Good night, Gary.  Oh...what the...?
No, Patrick, no, Patrick, no, Patrick, no, Patrick! Wake up! Wake up! It's me, SpongeBob!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
Squidward? Squidward?
Squidward?
Squidward, could we stay here a couple of days or a month or two?
Thanks. Thanks, Squidward.  Squidward, could you scoot over a little?
While you're at it, could you get me a glass of water?
Yeah, this is a real swell place you got here.  Thanks, buddy.
Yeah, I like sleepovers.
Yep, this is great. Good night, Squidward.
Don't worry, Squidward. I'll come visit you.
Here come my parents.
Hi, Mom.
Just give me a minute.  I cannot hold onto you any longer, little pebble.  You hold too many memories.  Well, Squidward, this is goodbye.
Goodbye, Patrick. Goodbye, Bikini Bottom.
My house is back!  Aww! Good old pineapple! It was exactly where it used to be!  Aww, Squidward, isn't this great? I'm back forever!
