Squidward
 Squidward, wait
You dropped this little piece of paper
I just figured you probably want it back
Garbage
 But, Squidward, in the right hands, this paper is a gold mine of entertainment
 A spectacular afternoon of underwater fun
 A treasure trove of
So you don't want it
Does that mean I can have it
You sure
So are you definitely, positively sure
But are you
Last chance to change your mind, Squidward
So, I take that as a possible no
 Squidward
 Squidward
 Squidward
  Okay, Squidward, that's a promise I'll just have to keep
 Ah, Mr Paper, I am so lucky to have a friend like Squidward
I'm sorry, Squidward, it's just
  
it's just that I'm thinking of all the fun I'm going to have with this piece of paper
La, la, la, la, la
 Gary, watch this
  Guess what I am
Well, yes, Gary, I am a sponge with paper stuck in his pants, but I'm also
  Super Sponge, soaking up crime
 See, here's my cape
Now I'm
  SpongeBob JunglePants
Ugh
 SpongeBob JunglePants summon animal friends
You're right, Gary
 I'm not a jungle boy
 I'm a box of army supplies,  bringing relief to the hungry troops
  Landing just in time for the bullfight
  Toro, toro, Gary
 Toro, toro
 Toro, Gary, toro
  Hey, ole
 Now for some impressions
 A guy with a mustache
  Look at me, I'm a guy with a mustache
 A pirate with an eye patch
  Arrgh, I'm a pirate
 A regular guy with an eye patch
  Arrgh, I am not a pirate
Look, Gary, oral-gami
Isn't this great
 La-la-la-la-la
  La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Oh, that's a good one, Squidward, now let me try
  Have you heard any good jokes, Mr Paper
I don't know, what happened to the paper that fell in the ocean
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Nope
Hooray
 Hooray
 That was great, Squidward
 All those wrong notes you played made it sound more original
Yeah, see, you're playing it like this
  
when ordinarily it goes like this
  I'm partial to doing it in the key of A-minor myself
  Ah, nothing like a duet between buddies, eh, Squidward
I can't
I can't
 You made me promise no matter how much you begged, and pleaded, and cried not to give the paper back to you ever
Sure you did, Squidward, look
Wanna see it again
Sorry, Squidward, I am sworn to a promise
  Maybe I should get going
Wow, pocket lint
  You drive a hard bargain, Squidward
 Paper for lint, hmmm
The rubber band
 Do I dare
Okay
  Oh, I get it
 You're just testing me
 Don't worry, Squidward, I won't let you down
 A promise is a promise
Squidward
Hey, listen
Oh, Squidward, is this still part of the test
 Because it's
it's really getting harder and harder to keep my promise
Squidward's shirt
 I've always loved that shirt
 Okay, okay, I'll trade
  I can break a promise for this
 Squidward, do you want your other stuff, â€˜cause this is all I'll need
