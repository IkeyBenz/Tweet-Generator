Wow, four stingers.  Where have I seen this before?  Here it is.  Land squirrel.  That little squirrel is in trouble.
Hooray, land squirrel!  Look out!  Hold on, little squirrel!  You have fought well, giant clam. Prepare to be vanquished! Hai!  Hey, I'm actually doing it.  Your shell is mine!
Hey, you like karate too.  So, uhh, what's your name?
I'm SpongeBob!
Oh.  Oh yeah? Watch this
Uh, I like you too, Sandy. Hi-yah!  Ow. Say, what is that thing on your head?
May I try it on?
Me too. I love air. Air is good.
Why, "air" is my middle name. The more air, the better. Can't get enough of that air.
Okay, see you tomorrow.  Patrick! Patrick! Patrick, Patrick, Patrick! What's air?
I just met this girl. She wears a hat full of... air.
I guess so.
How's that?
Like that?
Thanks, pal.
Hi-ya, Sandy. It’s me, SpongeBob.
Sandy! Sandy! Open up! Sandy! Sandy!  Sandy, something's gone terribly wrong. There's no water in...  ...here.
No water?
Problem?  Hi-yah! That's how I like my air!  With no water.
I brought you some flowers.
Yes, I'm okay.
I can’t imagine why.
Water would be nice.
Take your time.  I gotta get out of here! Aaaaahh!
I don't need water! Water's for quitters! I don't need it! I don't need it! I don't need it! I don't need it, I don't need it...
I don't need it, I don't need it, I definitely don't need it.  I don't need it.  I don't need it.  I don't need it.  I don't need it.  I need it!
I'm a quitter!
Air is not good, Patrick. Air is not good.
I tried to tell you!
You're... doing it... wrong...
