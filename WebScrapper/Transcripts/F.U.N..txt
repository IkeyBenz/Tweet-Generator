A-ha!  Hey!  Okay, that's far enough! Huh?  Tartar sauce!
Have you seen a Krabby Patty? It's about this tall and...  Wow, a magic shop! Are you a magician? One time, I saw this magician and he did this thing...anyway, and then he told us, If you believe in yourself and with a tiny pinch of magic, all of your dreams can come true.
Plankton! It's you!
Aww, cheer up, Plankton. I think you're a winner.
I said, you're a--
I'll bet if he had just one friend, he wouldn't be such a meanie.
Hi, Mr. Plankton.
No. I mean...I want you to come out and play with me.
Play with me.
No, but I like to go jelly...
...fishing with my friends at Jellyfish Fields.
Great!  Last one to the fields is a rotten clam!  So, I get the big net and you get the little net.
You don't eat 'em, you catch 'em, like this!  Like that.
And then you throw them back. But watch out for the stingers!

Fun is when you... fun is... it's like... it's kinda... sorta like a...
What is fun? Let me spell it for you. ♪F is for friends who do stuff together, U is for you and me, N is for anywhere, anytime at all!♪

Plankton-buddy! Let’s go! I forgot this is a no friend zone!
What's this all about, Mr. Krabs?
Why can't you just accept our friendship?

I sure like sequels, Plankton.  Hey, Bubble Bass, you're sitting on my friend.  Hey, Bubble Bass!
Sure thing.
Mr. Krabs?
I cant believe this!
What is it then? Tell me what you see here!
How can you not see it!?
But we sang The F.U.N. Song!  I think I'm gonna be sick! How long?
How long were you planning on doing this?!  Tell me!
What?!
Really?
Mr. Krabs, he's gone. He got the patty. He won.
I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs. I thought Plankton had changed.
Aye, aye, Mr. Krabs!
